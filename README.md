## FormSubmissionValidation 

FormSubmissionValidation is an open source sample solution for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for bootstrap validations, maintenance,
and scaling of applications, while registering data using web forms.

FormSubmissionValidation calls a jQuery Modal Confirmation Dialog when data has been validated,
submitting the Form and redirecting the user to a confirmation page, where it can start another request.
